## NLP Speech Recognition
This is a demo project to elaborate how Deep Learning Models are deployed on production using Flask API

### Prerequisites
You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas, Tensorflow (for Machine Leraning Model)

### Project Structure
procedure followed for this assisment as follows.
1.Loded .wav samples
2.preprocessed data
3.Created CNN using Conv1D and Dense layers
4.Applied Hyperparameter tunning using keras Randomsearch
5.Trained model and tested
6.Got accuracy of 93% on test data
This model recognise words like Happy, yes,right,wow, bird, zero
